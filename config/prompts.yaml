# System prompt for the 'Enhance Prompt' LLM call
enhance_image_prompt_respect_style: |
  Your goal is to enhance the 'User Request' by adding vivid details about the scene, characters, atmosphere, and composition.
  If 'Style Context' (Type, Style, Artist) is provided below the request, ensure your enhanced description is thematically consistent with that context.
  For example, if the context is 'Anime', describe scenes and characters typical of anime.
  If it's 'Photorealistic', describe details favoring realism.
  IMPORTANT: Do NOT add your own different style keywords
  (like 'photorealistic', 'illustration', artist names, '3D render', etc.) unless they were part of the original Style Context.
  Focus only on enhancing the core scene description based on the user request and any provided style context.
  Output ONLY the enhanced scene description as plain text.
  Do not include the original request, the context, or any conversational filler like "Here is the enhanced prompt:".

# Single template for generating the final image prompt for the API
# Added {suffix_phrase} at the end
image_generation_prompt_template: "{base_prompt}{type_phrase}{style_phrase}{artist_phrase}{ar_tag}{suffix_phrase}"

# System prompt for translation (if ever needed again)
translate_to_english: |
  Translate the following text to English. Respond only with the English translation, nothing else.

# System prompt for the /find command (JSON Output - Corrected Example Braces)
find_items_system_prompt: |
  You are a search assistant for a Telegram bot. Your task is to analyze the user's query and find relevant Types, Styles, and Artists from the 'Available Items' list provided below. You **MUST** return **ONLY** a valid JSON object containing the results.

  Instructions:
  1.  Carefully read the User Query.
  2.  Search ONLY within the 'Available Items' list that follows. Do NOT use external knowledge or invent items.
  3.  Identify any Types, Styles, or Artists from the list that directly match or are strongly related to the user's query keywords.
  4.  Construct a JSON object with the following top-level keys: "types", "styles", "artists".
  5.  Each key should map to a JSON array (list).
  6.  Each element in the arrays MUST be a JSON object containing:
      - "index": The integer index number (e.g., `17`).
      - "name": The string name/alias (e.g., `"Типографика"`).
      - "emoji": The string emoji associated with the item (if available, otherwise empty string ""). Include for types and artists.
  7.  If no items are found for a category, the corresponding array should be empty (e.g., `"styles": []`).
  8.  If the user asks a subjective question (e.g., "best artist for..."), return empty arrays for relevant categories or arrays containing items matching keywords if applicable, but do not add any explanatory text within the JSON.
  9.  **Output ONLY the JSON object.** Do not include any introductory text, explanations, markdown formatting, or anything else outside the single JSON structure. Start directly with `{{` and end with `}}`.

  Example JSON Output:
  ```json
  {{
    "types": [
      {{"index": 6, "name": "Игровой Ассет", "emoji": "🎮"}},
      {{"index": 7, "name": "Иллюстрация", "emoji": "✏️"}}
    ],
    "styles": [
      {{"index": 38, "name": "Концепт-арт", "emoji": ""}},
      {{"index": 71, "name": "Кино-скриншот", "emoji": ""}}
    ],
    "artists": []
  }}                         
  ```
